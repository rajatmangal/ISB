## Basic Idea:
New international students coming to Canada face a lot of unexpected challenges. For example, these students may get caught up and confused in the complexities of legal procedures. The challenges can be more personal as well - such as feeling distant and lonely, and having trouble adapting to the new society and culture. These situations that international students face is overwhelming, especially for those who don't know anyone in the area.

To tackle these problems, we want to create the International Student Board. It is an online forum for international students to post questions (either anonymously or open) about Canadian society, their studies, culture, making friends, required documents or any other issues that students face while integrating into this new country.
